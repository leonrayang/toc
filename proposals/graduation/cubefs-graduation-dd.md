# CubeFS Graduation Due Diligence

- Link to [CubeFS Graduation application](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/1140)

  <!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

  Currently, the maintainers of CubeFS are generally balanced between major vendors and active contributors. Some personnel changes have been made based on activity levels, and new key contributors need to be added to the maintainer list.

  - The latest personnel changes are based on the new governance document and voting principles.[link to pr](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/3311)
  - Historical changes: New maintainers are being added because individuals have been the main contributors to the project.[link to pr](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/2228/files)
  - Historical changes: The maintainer update is due to insufficient activity levels from many individuals.[link to pr](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/3044)
