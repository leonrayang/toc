# CubeFS Graduation Due Diligence

- Link to [CubeFS Graduation application](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/1140)

  <!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

### Suggested

- [ ] **Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**

  <!-- (TOC Evaluation goes here) -->

  - CubeFS inintail governance: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/017c689013cfaef9c430680bc2c68f62c25a8fa9/GOVERNANCE.md#credits>
  - Added Commiter role in May. 2023: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/1976>
  - Added Steering Committee in Apr. 2024: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/3312>
  - Update maintainer list according to activity and add steering commitee member: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/3311>
  - Update the Governance Document to eliminate the role of the leader: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/3382>
    The description of 'project lead' implies a somewhat authoritarian role, but with the establishment of a steering committee, the steering committee should be considered the highest decision-making body.Thus CubeFS delete the role of 'project lead'.

  > As an open-source distributed storage, CubeFS can serve as your datacenter filesystem, data lake storage infra, and private or hybrid cloud storage. 
  > In particular, CubeFS enables the separation of storage/compute architecture for databases and AI/ML applications.
  > 
  > Some key features of CubeFS include:
  > 
  > - Multiple access protocols such as POSIX, HDFS, S3, and its own REST API
  > - Highly scalable metadata service with strong consistency  
  > - Performance optimization of large/small files and sequential/random writes
  > - Multi-tenancy support with better resource utilization and tenant isolation
  > - Hybrid cloud I/O acceleration through multi-level caching
  > - Flexible storage policies, high-performance replication or low-cost erasure coding

<!-- 
  Project’s differentiation documented in [#why-cubefs](https://cubefs.io/docs/master/overview/introduction.html#why-cubefs)

  File storage and object storage are key in the storage domain. CubeFS is a file storage system that provides cloud-native file system capabilities and is compatible with object storage. Moreover, it offers a multitude of competitive features and capabilities. The project’s differentiation is the main feature of CubeFS: [link to md#section](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/master/README.md#what-can-you-build-with-cubefs)
